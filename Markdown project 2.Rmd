## Assignment objectives

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Mtcars

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x=~wt, y=~hp, color= as.factor(mtcars$cyl), text = paste("Weight:", mtcars$wt))
```

## Iris

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Petal.Length, mode = "markers", color = iris$Species)
```
